# Football-Team-Cards
One common aspect of building web applications: processing datasets, and then outputting information to the screen. In this sports team cards project, I worked with DOM manipulation, object destructuring, event handling, and data filtering.

This project I had cover concepts like switch statements, default parameters, Object.freeze(), the map() method, and more.
